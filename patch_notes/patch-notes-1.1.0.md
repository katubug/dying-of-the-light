# **Script and Config Changes**

- Removed the Zombie Awareness mod because it was way too overtuned, even with the changes I'd made to it.
- Sanity has been ever so slightly tweaked: it drains slightly less quickly, and will slowly increase during the rain.
- Sanity's post-processing effects have been disabled because they're really obtrusive and make it like, impossible to see.
- On that note, tweaked some settings with the Insanity shaders to make the fog a little less oppressive, the world a little bit brighter overall, and to fix an issue with certain water blocks completely missing their textures.
- Replaced the broken Void Tome with a custom placeholder which isn't broken on servers. It will eventually have functionality, but as of right now is just an item which drains sanity while holding it, used for quests.
- The pack now correctly comes with keybindings and options!
- The serverpack now includes the Better Lightning mod, as it's required on both client and server.
- Moved the Lightroom quest down onto the actual quest background, and made it a dependency to the main checkmark quest.
- The quest "A Pasttime" now makes it a little more clear that it's important (it unlocks fishing quests!)
- The Welcome quest now correctly gives 4 Dark Oak saplings, lol.
- Updated a resourcepack and thus also the resource pack overrides config.
- Added in some needed null checks to a few scripts, this should prevent log spam in certain cases when using the Camera Obscura.
